Here are the list of Security Headers that can be set by the server in the response header list.

1. HSTS header (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
Server cant have http references of content in its response, it will get redirected to https automatically
Client will not be able to hit http by himself
Even if MITM tries to give a fake cert to user thinking user might accept the bad cert, HSTS will prevent the user from accepting.
Domain owners can go and register in hstspreload site telling their website is always on https(chrome,safari and firefox) supports it.

2. X-XSS-Protection
Can have the following values -
0 (disabled)
1 (enabled)
1;mode=block
1;report-uri=http://yourdomaintoreport.com

3. CSRF header

4. X-Frame-Options
This is to prevent Click-Jacking attack where the server is telling the client browser not to allow the browser to load this page as
frames in another web page.

Here are the options:
deny
sameorigin
allow-origin: DOMAIN

5. X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies
none
master
all
filename

Basically its a policy xml file that says the web clients (like Adobe Flash) can access content from another domain.

6. HPKP (HTTP Public Key Pinning)
The server adds this header with the public key's hash / fingerprint so that the client can verify. 
This says that there is a pinning to point out the association between the server's public key and the certificate that the server sent.
This is used to prevent MITM.
Risky stuff and there should be enough Organizational maturity to carry this out else they(service owners) will make themselves unavailable.

7. Content Security Policy
script-src 'self'
style-src 'self'
img-src 'self'
