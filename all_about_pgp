Pretty Good Privacy is an encryption software that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication. Freeware developed by Phil Zimmerman.

Often used for encryption, decryption, signing of files, directories, Filesystem (whole disk encryption), secure email communications.

Follows OpenPGP standard.

PGP was said to be using the popular system named as Web Of Trust (A knows B so A sends her public key to B and B signs it and keeps a copy of it. C doesn't know A but C knows B
and B's public key is with C as they have communicated before. Hence, on word of trust from B, C now can trust A as well and start communicating). 
The Web of Trust was quite contrary to the hierarchical system that was used in x.509 systems where all of them don't trust each other but only trust the CA.

Backward compatibility in PGP is poor.

PGP exchanges messages using Digital Envelopes.

PGP has its own digital certificates but not similar to x.509 certificates that come in PKI.

The user's private key is generated and encrypted when the applications asks the user to randomly type something in the keyboard.
PGP uses passphrases instead of passwords that is used to encrypt the private key that was generated.
Keyring is the file in one's system that will have the list of  public keys that are good and trustworthy from the past communications. It will have a parameter
that defines the Level of Trust too with which you can sign one's public key.

Advantages:
Free
Complete cryptosystem
Ease of Use.

Disadvantages:
Revocation percolation is difficult.
Backward compatibility is poor.

Quantum Cryptography
Its all about photon guns, electromagnetic waves and the polarization of photons which could be either horizontal, veritical, left handed or right handed.
Even passively eavesdropping / sniffing is enough to change the attributes of polarization so detection is easily possible.
