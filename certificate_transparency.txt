Certificate transparency is an Open Framework where multiple bodies can keep a check on each other.

3 mail goals of Certificate Transparency :
-- > Make issuance of certificate to a domain extremely difficult and with lot of friction where the the cert cannot be issued without
     the domain owner getting to know about it by some means.
-- > Open Auditing & Monitoring by multiple bodies or by any one.
-- > Protect the users by all means possible.

How does Certificate Transparency work ?

It constitutes the following :
1. Certifcate Logs
Dedicated servers that maintain logs of the certificates that were issued and their status/ validity.
2. Monitors
Dedicated servers that can be started up by anybody that keeps a tab/check on the Certificate Log servers.
3. Auditors
Light weight software components that check on the following :
  -- Whethere logs are correct and behaving as expected.
  -- Particular cert is present in the Log.
  
Who maintains the above?
Mostly the CAs or the ISPs maintain but its not restricted and anyone interested can own dedicated servers to ensure the above is taken care.

What are we guarding or preventing from happening?
Rogues CAs
Misused certificates
Malicious Certs
