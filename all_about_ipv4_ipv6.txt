IP v4

IP version 4 addresses have run out due to the number of machines in the internet as of today.
They are 32 bit addresses with 4 octets which is 8 bit each.

Classful IP address scheme (Subnetting)
Class A - 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 (First octet represents the Network and the last 3 represent the Host machine in the network) 
Class B - 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 (First 2 octets represent the n/w and last 2 represent the host).
Class C - 191.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 ( First 3 represent the n/w and the last one represents the host).
Class D - 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 (Used for multicast address)
Class E - 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 (Used for research purpose)

Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR)
also called supernetting where each of the above classes can be made more flexible in terms of number of machines.


ipV6 or IPng (IP next gen)
Supports 128 bit address.
Supports IPSec
Supports QoS
Supports increased MTU (maximum transmission Unit)

Supports jumbograms where the size of the packet is not limited just to 65535 octets of payload.

NAT (Network Address Translation) is there which is slowing down IPv6 adoption. Many IPs behind a specific single IP. The single IP will ensure 
packet forwarding and port forwarding to the right client which made the request.
